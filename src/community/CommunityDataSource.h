	responsible for creating / maintaining the thread in which this call
	executes, and thus the protocol implementation need not worry about
	executing in a non-blocking manner - this call is completely blocking.
	
	@par
	This method should call the newCommunityItemArrived: 
	CommunityDataSourceDelegate method for every item received, the 
	userDataArrived: method for every unique myGov user encountered in the 
	set of community items downloaded (including the comments!), and the
	operationError: method to announce any errors that occur in the data
	download operation.
	
	@note This method should also download all relevent user data - the data
	      can be cached locally by the data source, but a call to the userDataArrived:
	      method must still occur for each unique user encountered in the 
	      community item data set.
